Thoughts and ideas
==================

Some thoughts and ideas I've had following alife2020.

* Autoconstructive evolution is a useful term for what I'm trying to do.

* Look at Push instruction set. But Caldo is not typed.

* Gene regulation: inhibit and excite. How would we start a new cell with
  inhibited/excited genes?

* We should create a 3d map of instructions and place instructions there.

* Definitely provide tools for homeostatis: inspect own levels of resources,
  and in environment.

* Julian Miller, CGP, cartesian genetic programming. What operators does it use?

* Downsampling lexicase selection: is a bit like "feeding" for correct answers
- of training cases.

* Enzyme Commission Numbers; what kind of enzymes are there and what do they do?

* Steal training scenarios from pushgp. Mirror image, smallest, string
lengths, vector average, replace space with, negative to zero, last index of
zero, x-word lines, syllables, compare string, double letters, scrabble score.

* Steal training cases from avida.

* Changing environments. We could have problems "per area". And problem solving
to do metabolism. We could also slowly change the environment, making problems
more complex, or shift the problem set.

* Sensing: Caldo life forms should be able to detect things at a certain
distance, not only close by.

* Susan Stepney, innovation in a stringmol artificial chemistry.

Noise
-----

We should have "noise" on each execution, even though that makes things slower
as this generates a natural source of mutation. Very rarely pertubation should
be huge. This is the only form of mutation.

A possible optimization is to "compile" but every n instructions we execute
one in the uncompiled perturbed style. We can easily track which is the next
pertubation point.
