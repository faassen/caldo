What we would like
==================

Invocation
----------

* Invoke instruction.

* Look up gene, invoke right away.

* Look up gene from top of stack, invoke right away.

* Look up gene from top of stack, place gene id on top of stack.

Genes and instructions are in a different namespace.

Input queues are also addressable, in the same namespace as genes. When an
input queue is invoked, the first item in the queue is placed on the
processor's stack. When an output queue is invoked, the top of the stack is
placed on the output queue.

Compilation
-----------

Before a gene can be invoked, it needs to be compiled first. The compilation
turns instruction numbers into fixed instructions. The compile can have
a pertubation vector that changes how lookups world.

When addressing a gene for reading or construction, the original is addressed,
not the compiled version.

When invoking a gene, the compiled version is addressed.

Cell
----

A cell has a shared pool of molecules. All genes use this pool.

Execution uses ATP. Instructions use I. Maintaining the barrier
uses B.

The barrier erodes over time. If it's not maintained, the cell will
die.

If no ATP is available for running instructions, execution will halt.

A cell may communicate with the outside world. An input queue can
be used to get information about the environment. It also can be connected
to an output queue with the same lookup in another neighboring cell.

A cell may also take up materials from the outside world. An ingest
source can ingest materials from the outside world. An expell target
can emit materials into the outside world. An expell target can also
be connected to an ingest source in a nearby other cell.
