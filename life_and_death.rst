When does a cell die and what happens?
======================================

A cell wall is slowly decaying all the time. A cell dies if it's wall is down
to 0. The cell can inspect and invest in the cell wall. This costs wall
material.

Once a cell dies, its component materials end up in the environment. This
includes the storage inside the cell, as well as the materials used
to construct genes. ATP immediately dissipates as it has no long
term existence.

How does a gene get created?
============================

When a gene is first created, the only way to address it is via
its gene_id. Once a first instruction is added, it's added to the
lookup space.

A gene can have a processor started on it at any point; it can only
grow at the end.
