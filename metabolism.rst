Metabolism
==========

Metabolism and ports.

An organelle is something that is:

* lookup addressable.

* has a unique organelle id per cell

Organelles can do different things:

* Observe/talk to the outside world.

* Do metabolism.

* Ingest/expel chemicals to/from the outside world.

* Create new cell.

* Create a new gene?

* Transfer/admit genes from another, connected cell.

Metabolism organelles
---------------------

A gene needs to get items from its queue and then send items back.

How does this work -- what if the queue is very full? Or is the queue
never going to be added to until an answer is given? I think that can work.

If a more correct answer is given, more metabolism takes place.

How much of the "reaction" takes place depends on how much the cell
wants to do, with some gradual limits perhaps.

Other actions
-------------

Each action has a lookup id.

Other organelles can also be addressed to cause chemicals to be ingested
or expelled.

Connection
----------

An organelle may cause a connection to another. Or perhaps connections
are their own thing.


Possible operations
-------------------

Basic mathematical operators

Basic equality operators

Basic boolean operators

Combinations of such - an exponential equation for instance.
