* Flatten instruction

* An arena for genes?

  A gene is:

  * immutable.

  * lives as long as its cell.

  * can be moved to another cell.

  * may be explicitly destroyed in a cell.

 If we stored the genes in a generational arena, we can
 reference ids all we like. Or should we instead use
 Rc?


For the call behavior we need:

* a way to get the gene_id for a particular number.

* a way to get the gene object belonging to a gene_id.

* this can then modify the processor's gene stack.
