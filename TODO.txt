* Flatten instruction

* An arena for genes?

  A gene is:

  * immutable.

  * lives as long as its cell.

  * can be moved to another cell.

  * may be explicitly destroyed in a cell.

 If we stored the genes in a generational arena, we can
 reference ids all we like. Or should we instead use
 Rc?
