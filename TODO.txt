* Flatten instruction

* An arena for genes?

  A gene is:

  * immutable.

  * lives as long as its cell.

  * can be moved to another cell.

  * may be explicitly destroyed in a cell.

 If we stored the genes in a generational arena, we can
 reference ids all we like. Or should we instead use
 Rc?


For the call behavior we need:

* a way to get the gene_id for a particular number.

* a way to get the gene object belonging to a gene_id.

* this can then modify the processor's gene stack.


An arena of cells.

An arena of processors per cell. Or an arena of processors?

An arena of genes per cell.

How do I make the tests work if we don't have an arena.

How do I even access the arena?
